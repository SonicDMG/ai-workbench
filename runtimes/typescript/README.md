# AI Workbench — TypeScript Runtime

This is the **default, production-ready** AI Workbench runtime.
It serves the full `/api/v1/*` contract, hosts the embedded web UI,
and is the only runtime bundled into the published Docker image.
Python and Java runtimes (under `../python/` and `../java/`) are
preview scaffolds working toward parity through the same conformance
fixtures.

For the cross-runtime architecture and contract spec, see
[`docs/green-boxes.md`](../../docs/green-boxes.md) and
[`docs/architecture.md`](../../docs/architecture.md).

## Quickstart

```bash
# From the repo root
cd runtimes/typescript
npm install
npm run dev          # tsx watch — hot-reloads on save
```

The runtime listens on `http://localhost:8080` by default.
Routes you'll touch first:

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `GET /healthz` | Liveness probe |
| `GET /readyz` | Readiness (workspace count) |
| `GET /docs` | Scalar-rendered API reference |
| `GET /api/v1/openapi.json` | Machine-readable contract |
| `GET /api/v1/workspaces` | Workspace list |

The embedded UI loads from `apps/web/dist/` if present. Run
`npm --prefix ../../apps/web run build` once to populate it; the
runtime auto-detects the bundle and serves it at `/`.

## Configuration

Configuration is layered:

1. `workbench.yaml` (canonical) — see
   [`docs/configuration.md`](../../docs/configuration.md) and the
   examples in [`examples/`](./examples/).
2. `.env` (repo root) — secrets and select runtime overrides. See
   [`.env.example`](../../.env.example) for the supported keys.
3. Process environment — wins over `.env` for matching keys.

The default control-plane driver is `memory` (no persistence). For
durable single-node deployments, switch to the `file` driver. For
clustered or production deployments, switch to `astra`. All three
implement the same `ControlPlaneStore` contract; conformance tests
exercise each.

### Common environment variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Override `runtime.logLevel` (`trace`/`debug`/`info`/`warn`/`error`) |
| `WORKBENCH_CONFIG_FILE` | Path to `workbench.yaml` (default: repo-root) |
| `WORKBENCH_ENV_FILE` | Override `.env` path |
| `ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT` / `ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN` | Astra control-plane credentials (auto-resolved from `astra` CLI when present) |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Default chat/embedding credential; chat returns `503 chat_disabled` until set (not needed for the `ollama` provider). `OPENAI_API_KEY` is the direct/BYOK alternative. |
| `APP_VERSION` / `APP_COMMIT` / `APP_BUILD_TIME` | Set by the Docker build to override [`src/version.ts`](src/version.ts) defaults |

## npm scripts

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | tsx watch — local dev with hot reload |
| `npm start` | Run the compiled `dist/root.js` (used inside the Docker image) |
| `npm run build` | `tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` — emit JS to `dist/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Strict typecheck without emitting |
| `npm test` | `vitest run` — unit + integration + conformance drift guard |
| `npm run test:coverage` | `vitest run --coverage` — enforces ratcheted thresholds |
| `npm run test:watch` | `vitest` — watch mode |
| `npm run conformance:mock` | Boot the mock-Astra server (used by conformance tests) |
| `npm run conformance:regenerate` | Re-record `conformance/fixtures/*` from the TS runtime |
| `npm run smoke:astra` | One-shot smoke test against a real Astra DB |
| `npm run dump:openapi` | Write the generated OpenAPI doc to `dist/openapi.json` |

Tests live in `tests/` mirroring the `src/` tree, plus `tests/conformance/`
which exercises the cross-runtime fixtures in `../../conformance/`.

## Production hardening checklist

See [`docs/production.md`](../../docs/production.md) for the canonical
list. Quick-reference highlights:

- Set `runtime.environment: production` to enforce the hardening
  checks (durable control plane, auth.mode != disabled, anonymousPolicy:
  reject, https publicOrigin, RFC1918 endpoint block, ...).
- Configure `auth.mode: apiKey` or `oidc` (NOT `disabled`).
- Set `runtime.publicOrigin` to your https URL — the runtime uses it
  to derive secure-cookie + OIDC redirect URIs without trusting
  spoofable Host headers.
- Provide `auth.oidc.client.sessionSecretRef` for clustered deploys.
  Without it, the runtime generates an ephemeral key per replica and
  sessions break across pod restarts / load-balanced replicas.
- Add network egress controls upstream of the runtime; the
  `runtime.blockPrivateNetworkEndpoints` schema check is layered
  defense, not a substitute for VPC NetworkPolicies.

## Troubleshooting

- **`startup secret check failed for N ref(s)`** — the preflight
  walks every `*Ref` in your config and probes the resolver. The
  message names which refs and why; usually a missing `.env` value or
  a typo'd `env:VAR_NAME`.
- **`ui disabled — no dist found`** — run
  `npm --prefix apps/web run build` from the repo root, then restart.
- **Astra `controlPlane.driver` 401** — the token in `tokenRef` may
  not have access to the configured keyspace. Confirm with
  `npm run smoke:astra`.
- **Conformance drift test fails** — your route changes affect the
  shape of an existing response. Review the diff, then either
  `npm run conformance:regenerate` (intentional) or revert
  (regression). See [`../../conformance/README.md`](../../conformance/README.md).
